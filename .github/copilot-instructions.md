- always use "uv" when running the \*.py files or python based scripts /packages
- always ensure proper cleanup of resources
- for terminal commands like "find", "grep" initially identify what command is available in the environment
- do not create big inputs for terminal commands as it freezes the terminal
- do not use cat just to view files as it do not return to the terminal
